# Title: Fantasy Football Lineup Optimization with Monte Carlo Simulation

## Team Member(s): Alex Cavanaugh

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
The purpose uses a Monte Carlo simulation to create a distribution for player statistics that are relevant to fantasy
football. This information is then organized and presented to the user as a lineup of players that are likely to earn
the most points in a season.

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
The variables of uncertainty here are the methods that players can earn points. For example, throwing a touchdown pass,
making an interception, blocking a field goal, etc. In the simulation, a random year and week are selected (with more
recent years having a higher probability of being chosen), and the players points in a certain stat during that random
year/week give the value for the variable. I chose to weigh more recent years more heavily since a players performance
is likely a slow-changing variable.

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:
I think this program may skew towards picking groups of players that generally have big plays together, such as a QB and
WR. However, this may not be the best strategy in fantasy football since you're putting all your eggs in one basket, so
to speak. So, I think this could end up creating a very successful team (if the group has a lot of good plays) or an
awful team (if the group does not make big plays).

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)
